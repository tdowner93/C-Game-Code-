# How It Works
The game works by randomizing the course length, club distances, and allowing the player to choose clubs. After each shot, the ball position is updated, and the course is printed. Once the ball reaches the hole, it stays there, and the game ends.

# Example Gameplay:

Round Start: The course length is randomized (e.g., 300 yards).

Player Chooses Clubs: The player selects Driver, Iron, Chipper, or Putter based on the distance.

Shot Feedback: The distance traveled by the ball and the ball's position is shown.

Round End: The ball reaches the hole, and the game ends with a summary of the shots taken.

Now, the ball will stay at the hole when the game ends, making the final display visually correct.
